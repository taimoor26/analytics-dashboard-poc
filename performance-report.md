# Performance Report – Real-time Analytics Dashboard POC

## Load Handling Proof
- **Throughput:** Sustained 1 000 sensor readings/sec generated by `SensorSimulatorService`.
- **Memory:** In-memory ring buffer stores 100 k points = ~8–12 MB.
- **Persistence:** SQLite stores 1-second aggregates → ~86 k rows/day.
- **Latency:** Measured <100 ms from generation to UI display.

## Metrics & Testing Methodology
- Ran backend with simulator active for >1 h.
- Monitored memory in `dotnet-counters` and SQLite file size.
- Verified frontend charts kept up with live stream.
- Queried `/stats` to confirm aggregates updated in near real time.

## How AI Helped Identify Bottlenecks
- AI initially suggested raw inserts; we challenged that and designed aggregated storage.
- AI scaffolded SSE streaming; we tuned it to send batches every 100 ms to avoid HTTP overhead.
- AI produced the initial chart components; we optimized them to keep only last 200 points per sensor in state.

## Result
System meets test-task specs:
- Handles 100 k in-memory points without degradation.
- 24-hour data retention with auto-purge.
- Live charts, aggregated statistics, and alert system implemented.
